## üì¢ About This Project
This repository contains an **SQL-based Retail Sales Data Analysis** project. It involves analyzing sales transactions to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries. The dataset includes details about product sales, pricing, customer behavior, and revenue trends.

--------------------------------------

## üéØ Objectives
‚úÖ Perform data cleaning and transformation.  
‚úÖ Analyze product sales and revenue trends.  
‚úÖ Extract insights about customer purchase behavior.  
‚úÖ Practice SQL queries for business intelligence.

    category VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    quantity_sold INT,
    total_revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
    transaction_date DATE,
    customer_id VARCHAR(50),

## üìù Data Analysis & Business Key Problems
---------------------------

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:
 ```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```
---------------------------
2. **Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Clothing' 
     AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')='2022-11'
     AND quantiy>=4;
```

----------------------------------------------------
3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category:
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) as total_sale,
COUNT(*)AS Total_order
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

--------------------------------------------------------
4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category:
```sql
SELECT category, CAST(AVG(age)AS DECIMAL(10,2))as Average_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Beauty'
GROUP BY category;
```
------------------------------------

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000:
``` sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale>1000;
```
--------------------------------------

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category:
```sql
SELECT gender,category, COUNT(transactions_id)AS total_transaction
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY gender,category
ORDER BY category;
```
---------------------------------------
7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:
```sql
SELECT * FROM
(
   SELECT
            EXTRACT('year' FROM sale_date)AS year,
	    EXTRACT('month' FROM sale_date)AS month,
            CAST(AVG(total_sale) AS DECIMAL(10,2))AS Avg_sales,
	    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT('year' FROM sale_date) ORDER BY CAST(AVG(total_sale) AS DECIMAL(10,2))DESC)AS rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY year,month

)
AS t1
WHERE rank=1;
```
-------------------------------------
8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales:
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(total_sale)AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales	   
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

-----------------------------------
9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category:
```sql
SELECT category,
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)as unique_custermer
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```
-------------------------------------
10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders:
--(Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
```sql
SELECT sale_time ,
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT('hour' FROM sale_time)<12 THEN 'MORNING'
        WHEN EXTRACT('hour' FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'AFTERNOON'
    ELSE 'EVENING'
END AS shift
FROM retail_sales;

--Common Transaction Expression

WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT sale_time ,
    CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT('hour' FROM sale_time)<12 THEN 'MORNING'
         WHEN EXTRACT('hour' FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'AFTERNOON'
    ELSE 'EVENING'
END AS shift
FROM retail_sales
)

SELECT shift, COUNT(*)as total_orders
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift;
```
